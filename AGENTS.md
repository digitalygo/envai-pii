# Agents quality baseline

When edits touch the codebase, run the tests that cover the changed files before you finish. Fix every failure and re-run until all delta tests pass.

## Delta tests

- Map every behavior change to at least one test and run those tests, plus anything upstream they exercise.
- All mapped delta tests must pass. Never weaken, skip, or delete a test to make a run green.
- Failures outside the delta do not block. Report them as out-of-scope signals instead of fixing them inside an unrelated change.
- Keep coverage between 80% and 100% on the executable lines the delta adds or modifies, and report the coverage result with the change. For non-executable changes such as configuration, documentation, or generated artifacts, mark tests and coverage N/A with a short justification.

## File length

- Treat length as a contextual maintainability control, not a numerical cap. Judge it together with cohesion and separability.
- Production code normally falls in the 500 to 700 line range. Cohesive tests may reasonably approach 1000 lines.
- Never thin tests, drop cases, or split cohesive fixtures or long inputs merely to reduce length.
- Split a file across multiple files only when the file shows materially poor navigation or maintainability and a meaningful split by behavior or responsibility exists.

## Code comments

- Never write code comments. Clear naming and structure explain the code.
- If code seems to need a comment, simplify it or split it into smaller files instead.
- Use descriptive names for variables, functions, and files in place of annotation.

## Repository specifics

This repository is `digitalygo/envai-pii`, a Python 3.11+ API service. Run the full suite with `python -m unittest discover -v tests`. Workflow JavaScript tests also require `node`, which is available on GitHub-hosted Ubuntu runners.

CI installs only the pinned Flask and PyMuPDF versions read from `src/app/requirements-gpu.txt`, so the API and PDF tests run against a mocked model. The unit-test job downloads neither Torch nor models nor datasets. A GPU image build may download the public pinned model that is baked into the image. Training and real GPU inference remain outside CI.

Keep coverage at or above 80 percent of the executable lines added or changed by a delivery. Treat configuration-only changes as tests and coverage not applicable, with a short justification.

The "Never write code comments" quality rule applies to new files. Docstrings are allowed. Do not rewrite existing comments in untouched code.

Renovate manages the Python, Docker, Compose, and GitHub Actions manifests weekly. The CUDA PyTorch pins in `src/app/requirements-gpu.txt` and the matching literal pin in `Dockerfile.gpu` are coupled to the official cu130 wheel index and must be upgraded together by hand. The inline pip pins in `Dockerfile` are also manual.

When these workflows first land on a releasing branch with no release tags, the landing commit must contain `[skip ci]`; verify that it creates no accidental first release. Follow the [CI activation and bootstrap guide](docs/ci-release.md) before enabling publication. Never reuse local CLI credentials as `RELEASE_TOKEN` automatically.
